# How to choose a validator

Disclaimer: There is no validator affiliated with Solstake and Solstake

Quote of solana-labs doc:

"After you have received SOL, you might consider putting it to use by delegating stake to a validator. Stake is what we call tokens in a stake account. Solana weights validator votes by the amount of stake delegated to them, which gives those validators more influence in determining then next valid block of transactions in the blockchain. Solana then generates new SOL periodically to reward stakers and validators. You earn more rewards the more stake you delegate."

Factors:
- Yield, how close to the best return the validator is offering. At the moment the best performance is much lower than the inflation. This comprises the validator reliability and performance.
- Security, staking with a validator which has a small stake increases decentralization, staking with the biggest stakes decreases it. Stake concentration in two ways, by physical datacentre but also geographic location (too many validator in one country/continent)

There are several third party websites that can help you evaluate a validator
- https://validators.app Raw metrics as well as the "score" Solstake is using
- https://stakeview.app Current APY, and past epochs APY of staking rewards
- https://metrics.stakeconomy.com per validator dashboard, if you are ready to dive into low level, for validator publishing their data to it.
